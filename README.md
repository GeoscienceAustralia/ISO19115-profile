# ISO19115-profile


## Description
This repository contains the files used to describe and generate Geoscience Australia's profile of the [ISO19115-1:2014 'Geographic information -- Metadata'](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html) standard.

This profile extends the base ISO19115-1:2014 standard in accordance with Annex C "Metadata extensions and profiles" of the [ISO19115-1:2014 'Geographic information -- Metadata'](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html) documentation.  Our profile is used to ensure that some elements of the standard which are normally optional are compulsory so that those elements, such as dataset lineage, are always filled out by GA staff recording metadata for datasets. Our profile also implements several new type codes for things such as AssociationType which allow us to characterise relationships between objects described with this profile in ways not possible with the un-profiled standard. These include type codes such as 'derivedFrom' which indicated that a dataset is generally derived from another dataset. This is more general than the standard's own 'revisionOf' which implies that the revised dataset is substantially the same as the original.

Some elements of this profile allow us to relate elements modelled here to other models. For example, the 'derivedFrom' relationship mentioned above can be interpreted as a 'wasDerivedFrom' relationship as used in the [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) for provenance.

### Profile Extensions
Following are the ISO 19115-1:2014 elements that have been extended by the GA profile.

##### Metadata entity set information (MD_Metadata)

| Name | Definition | Change from ISO 19115-1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| metadataIdentifier | unique identifier for this metadata record | Optional -> Mandatory |
| parentMetadata | identification of the parent metadata record |  Conditional -> Conditional (changed condition) |
| referenceSystemInfo | description of the spatial and temporal reference systems used in the resource | Optional -> Conditional |
| metadataConstraints | restrictions on the access and use of metadata | Optional -> Mandatory |
| metadataScope | the scope/type of resource for which metadata is provided  | Conditional -> Mandatory |
| resourceLineage | information about the provenance, source(s), and/or the production process(es) applied to the resource | Optional -> Mandatory |

##### Identification information (MD_Identification)
| Name | Definition | Change from ISO 19115-1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pointOfContact | identification of, and means of communication with, person(s) and organization(s) associated with the resource(s) | Optional -> Mandatory |
| topicCategory | main theme(s) of the resource | Conditional -> Mandatory |
| resourceMaintenance | information about the frequency of resource updates, and the scope of those updates | Optional -> Mandatory |
| resourceFormat | a description of the format of the resource(s) | Optional -> Mandatory |
| resourceConstraints | information about constraints which apply to the resource(s) | Optional -> Mandatory |
| descriptiveKeywords | category keywords, their type, and reference source | Optional -> Mandatory |

##### Constraint information (MD_Constraints)
| Name | Definition | Change from ISO 19115-1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reference | citation for the limitation or constraint, example: Copyright statement, licence agreement, etc. | Optional -> Mandatory |

##### Lineage information (LI_Lineage)
| Name | Definition | Change from ISO 19115-1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| statement | general explanation of the data producerâ€™s knowledge about the lineage of a dataset | Optional -> Mandatory |
| source | information about the source data used in creating the data specified by the scope | Conditional -> Mandatory |

##### Distribution information (MD_Distribution)
| Name | Definition | Change from ISO 19115-1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| distributionFormat | provides a description of the format of the data to be distributed | Optional -> Mandatory |

#### Codelists
This profile extends two ISO 19115-1 codelists:
* **Association Type (DS_AssociationTypeCode)**
* **Online Function (CI_OnLineFunctionCode)**

Two new codelists have been implemented to constrain ISO 19115-1 elements that are free text:
* **Service Type (serviceType -> gapMD_ServiceTypeCode_PropertyType)**
* **Protocol (protocol -> gapCI_ProtocolTypeCode_PropertyType)**

The authoritative values in the above codelists are maintained in [SKOS vocabularies](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) hosted by [Research Vocabularies Australia](https://vocabs.ands.org.au/).  The codelists are extracted from the vocabularies as XML files conforming to the CAT 1.0 schema.  The resulting codelist files, as well as scripts used to generate the codelists are stored in the [codelist/](codelist/) folder.


### Schema

Additional Schematron schema and XML Schema have been developed by GA to implement the rules defining the GA profile.  This profile's Schematron schema and XML Schema files are stored in this code repository.
